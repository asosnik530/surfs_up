###  Overview
 The analysis I performed was to show temperature trends to help an individual decide if a surf and ice cream shop would be sustainable for the entire year. 

### Results 
 - The mean temperature in June was 74.9, while in December it was 71.04. 
 - The minimum temperature in June was 64, while in December it was 56. 
 - The maximum temperature in June was 85, while in December it was 83. 
 
### Summary:
 - Although the minimum temperature was much lower in June, the average temperature did not have a major difference. The maximum temperature in December was in the 80's, similar to the meaximum temperature in June. 
 -One additional query to gather more weather data would be to show the number of days there was precipitation in June or December.
- Another additional query to gather more weather data would be to show the average, minimum and maximum temperature for the entire year, not just June and December.
